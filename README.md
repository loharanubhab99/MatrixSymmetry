# MatrixSymmetry
To check whether a matrix A is symmetric or not we need to check whether A = AT or not. Below is the step by step descriptive logic to check symmetric matrix.  Input elements in matrix A. Find transpose of matrix A, store it in some variable say B. Check if matrix A is equal to its transpose AT then it is symmetric matrix otherwise not. Means check if Aij = ATij (Where 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n) then the matrix is symmetric.
